Crpyto Project Readme
Going into this project, I wanted to uncover:
1. Is a certain weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly crypto buying schedule that could be expected to lead to higher returns?

2. Do the smaller/less popular coins have positive or negative correlations to the bigger coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum?

3. How long can investors expect a major or minor dip in price to last? What about a major/minor increase in price? By coin if possible

4. How do these returns compare to the Nasdaq/NYSE for the same time?

NOTE: THIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE INVESTMENT ADVICE
